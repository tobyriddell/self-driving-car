# self-driving-car
A project for Fern School's STEM club to help students get to grips with neural networks

This project was inspired by https://medium.com/@florianherrengt/building-a-basic-self-driving-rc-car-bca6a7521753, 
however there are some differences: I used a Raspberry Pi and a robot car chassis and all code was written in Python and executed
on the Raspberry Pi.

The goal was to lay the groundwork for grade 7/8 students to re-implement a self-driving car themselves, hence the Python scripts
are in separate files demonstrating the capturing of images, the processing of images, training the neural network and then using
the trained network to drive the car.
